# Review Questions

- How should we handle forms in ReactJS?
  - use control input/component
  - control input/component has its value in state and its also its reseting that value by state, so state is what is controlling the value of that input
- What is the difference between a class and a functional component? (ignoring hooks)
  - if we want to use state or any lifecycle methods we need to use a class component otherwise we can use a functinal component (unless we have hooks)
- Is React a language, library, or framework? (BONUS: give an example for the other two)
  - react is a library
  - example of a language is Ruby
  - example of framework is Rails 
  - framework -> consider it as having the batteries baked in, so its all set up to make a full complete web application
  - library -> you can kind of just pull in what you want. I'ts not set up out of the box to give you full complete web application
